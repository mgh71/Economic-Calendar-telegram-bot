An **[economic calendar](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/)** is a resource that allows traders to learn about important economic information scheduled
to be released in major economies. Such events might include familiar indicators such as GDP, the consumer price index (CPI), and the Non-Farm Payroll (NFPs) report. Further,
in todayâ€™s environment of fiscal cliffs and central bank intervention,
it can be very helpful to know the date of the next
central bank meeting or major news announcement.
